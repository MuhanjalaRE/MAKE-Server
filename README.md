# Welcome to MAKE!

Hi! MAKE is an abbreviation of Midair: Kommunity Edition, an open source modding tool for Midair: Community Edition. There are two projects under the MAKE umbrella, MAKE Server and MAKE Mods.

MAKE Server is a project involving the reverse engineering of the Midair client to turn it into a server.
MAKE Mods is a project similar to TAMods and allows the customisation of the game client by allowing HUD modifications.


# MAKE Server

MAKE Server allows you to turn the Midair client into a server so others may join and play with you. It also allows you to modify the game physics and weapons to create modified or totally custom game modes.

## Supported version

Currently MAKE Server only supports Midair: Community Edition version 1.9.1.12285. This is deemed as the most stable release of Midair: Community Edition to date (prior to net-code changes that reduced playability at higher pings and changes to maps such as Nightflare making it unplayable).
